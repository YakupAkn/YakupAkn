  "phantomlabs-challenge-2": "Precise measurement and reporting of environmental data such as CPU temperature, battery cycle, and disk usage across various hardware configurations (low RAM/CPU, old processors).",
  "phantomlabs-challenge-3": "Not publishing the full source code to minimize the risk of misuse, while effectively demonstrating the logical flow for educational purposes and ensuring the self-cleanup mechanism works flawlessly.",
  "phantomlabs-challenge-4": "Ensuring behavioral consistency across different test environments (virtual machine, physical device, domain joined vs standalone) and completing the analysis cycle without leaving forensic-safe artifacts.",
  "phantomlabs-section-system": "How the System Works",
  "phantomlabs-system-1": "<span class=\"font-medium text-white\">Inventory Collection:</span> CPU, RAM, OS version, installed security software, and hardware information are collected; all data is written to the local system_report.txt file.",
  "phantomlabs-system-2": "<span class=\"font-medium text-white\">Network and Connectivity Analysis:</span> Local IP, network interfaces, and basic connectivity mapping are performed (offline modules are used for network discovery).",
  "phantomlabs-system-3": "<span class=\"font-medium text-white\">Media and Peripheral Test:</span> Hardware compatibility is verified via screenshot and camera driver test (peripheral_test.jpg is created).",
  "phantomlabs-system-4": "<span class=\"font-medium text-white\">Artifact and Forensics Monitoring:</span> Windows Prefetch, Temp folders, and other digital traces are scanned; footprints left by the software on the system are reported.",

  "phantomlabs-system-6": "<span class=\"font-medium text-white\">Cleanup and Closure:</span> After analysis is complete, all temporary log and artifact files are automatically deleted (self-cleanup & final cleanup); the system reverts to its original state without leaving a trace.",
  "phantomlabs-section-tech": "Technical Decisions",
  "phantomlabs-tech-1": "All analysis operations run completely offline and locally — no data is sent to the network or server; to ensure 100% privacy and forensic security.",
  "phantomlabs-tech-2": "System integrity is preserved even in educational use with modular structure (each version adds a separate focus area) and debug/self-cleanup mechanisms.",
  "phantomlabs-tech-3": "Full source code is not published; only examples showing the logical flow are shared — a conscious choice to minimize the risk of misuse.",
  "phantomlabs-tech-4": "Environmental metrics (temperature, battery, disk) are fetched with psutil or similar libraries; optimized for low resource consumption.",
  "phantomlabs-tech-5": "The analysis cycle was made compliant with digital forensics standards via a three-stage methodology (inventory → behavior observation → cleanup).",
  "phantomlabs-section-results": "Results",
  "phantomlabs-result-1": "As of v13.0, a comprehensive offline endpoint analysis framework is completed; all modules are integrated and leave no trace with self-cleanup.",
  "phantomlabs-result-2": "Artifact detection and environmental monitoring worked 100% consistently in different test environments (Win10/11, low-mid range hardware).",
  "phantomlabs-result-3": "It succeeded in effectively demonstrating system analysis methodologies for educational use; the risk of misuse was kept near zero.",
  "phantomlabs-result-4": "It became a safe educational tool for ethical security research with zero network dependency and completely local processing."
